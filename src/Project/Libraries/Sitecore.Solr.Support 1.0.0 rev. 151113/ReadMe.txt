Important note on the installation of Solr:

Solr is an open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project. There are several different ways to install Solr, for example in Jetty or Tomcat / Linux or Windows. Your system administrator can help you choose the best approach. There are also many configuration options depending on your environment, the size of your installation, or the amount of items that you need to index.

There are four key parts to the Solr setup:

1. Configuring a Solr instance to use with Sitecore.
2. Configuring an IOC container.
3. Configuring Sitecore to work with the Solr provider.
4. Re-indexing all the content items.
